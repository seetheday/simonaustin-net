      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;took-over-ownership-of-sun-life-website&#34;&gt;Took over ownership of Sun Life website&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After my success optimizing the site, I fully took over the public facing website, adding agile development and publishing teams.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The team size is about 30 FTE&amp;rsquo;s across the Agile dev team, SEO content team, personalization team, and publishing team where I&amp;rsquo;ve been able to set them up so I manage a team of teams.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My role involves defining the technical vision, strategy, and multi-year roadmap for the Public Web. I work closely with UX, Marketing, and IT architecture teams to create innovative, user-friendly experiences that meet both customer needs and business goals.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;took-a-role-to-optimize-for-impact--driving-growth-and-breaking-barriers&#34;&gt;Took a role to optimize for impact.  Driving growth and breaking barriers.&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I’ve had the privilege of owning SEO, SEM and Digital Optimization for Sun Life Canada, leading a small but agile optimization team that could rapidly test ideas using Adobe Target and the expertise of our in-house designers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One of my proudest achievements was driving a 40% increase in advisor sales from our primary digital channel. This came through deep data analysis, rethinking media spend, and making significant process improvements.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I had a decision to make between going to Accenture and Sun Life.  I chose Sun Life because the role was interesting, and I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to be on the road 75% and away from my young family.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;during-a-downturn-opportunities-to-gain-skills&#34;&gt;During a downturn, opportunities to gain skills&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I continued leading all aspects of Digital Analytics but took on additional responsibilities as teams were laid off, including the technical leadership of Consumer and Enterprise CRM at BlackBerry.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One of my key projects was globally integrating the Eloqua system with Salesforce (SFDC), which helped streamline processes and improve efficiency as BlackBerry shifted focus from B2B2C to B2B. I also managed ExactTarget/Salesforce Marketing Cloud for our remaining B2C emails, ensuring our tools and systems were optimized for success.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Analytics Analyst → Analytics Manager</title>
      <link>https://simonaustin.net/experience/blackberry-analytics/</link>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;back-to-canada-and-working-for-a-tech-company&#34;&gt;Back to Canada, and working for a tech company&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Working at Deluxe paid well, and my e-commerce team was thriving. However, the teams around me were struggling with layoffs and downsizing. Sensing it might be time for a change, I started looking for my next opportunity and almost immediately, I got a call from BlackBerry with an offer to relocate me back to Canada.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This was BlackBerry before the iPhone era—a company at its peak and an incredible place to work. The pace was fast, and the pressure was high, but it was exhilarating. I was brought on to lead digital analytics, focusing on measuring website performance and evaluating the effectiveness of digital marketing campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;using-my-skills-to-make-a-living-wage&#34;&gt;Using my skills to make a living wage&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Looking back at my time at Openflows, it’s almost unbelievable how poorly I was paid—something that might be hard to imagine for today’s graduates. More than once considered taking up manual labor in construction, even temporarily, because it paid better.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;By 2005, the job market for technical roles was starting to improve, and I landed a position with the Canadian office of Deluxe Corporation in Midland, Ontario, as a Database Analyst. After quickly mastering their analytics systems, I was tasked with hiring a Digital Analyst for their U.S. office in Groton, MA.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;laying-the-foundation-forced-to-hustle&#34;&gt;Laying the Foundation: Forced to hustle&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I graduated university just as the dot-com bubble of the early 2000s was fully deflating. Like most of my graduating class, my full-time job offer—secured after a co-op role doing C/C++ development for a desktop application—vanished overnight.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Determined to keep moving forward, I took on whatever small local jobs I could find. If a project required a programming language I didn’t know, I learned it. Need someone to manage a *nix system? I was there. A database to set up or analyze? I’d handle that too.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
