      I‚Äôm curious, energetic, and driven by a passion for learning and problem-solving. My career has often placed me at the intersection of marketing, product, and technology. Whether it‚Äôs analyzing code, debugging SQL queries, proposing system architecture changes, or diving deep into analytics, I thrive on tackling challenges head-on.

      <p class="lead">
      At the same time, I‚Äôm equally at home conducting client interviews, reviewing UX designs, defining product strategies, or crafting performance marketing campaigns. This unique blend of skills allows me to bridge the gap between technical execution and strategic planning seamlessly.

      With a degree in Physics and Computer Science, I‚Äôve built a strong foundation for figuring out almost anything, a skillset honed early in my career and applied in fast-paced environments ever since.
