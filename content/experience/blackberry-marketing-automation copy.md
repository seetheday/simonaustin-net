### During a downturn, opportunities to gain skills

I continued leading all aspects of Digital Analytics but took on additional responsibilities as teams were laid off, including the technical leadership of Consumer and Enterprise CRM at BlackBerry.

One of my key projects was globally integrating the Eloqua system with Salesforce (SFDC), which helped streamline processes and improve efficiency as BlackBerry shifted focus from B2B2C to B2B. I also managed ExactTarget/Salesforce Marketing Cloud for our remaining B2C emails, ensuring our tools and systems were optimized for success.

Revamping the enterprise marketing-to-sales lead intake process was another significant accomplishment. I worked closely with stakeholders across the company to secure buy-in and implement a solution that worked seamlessly.

On top of that, I regularly reported to C-level executives, providing insights into Enterprise marketing performance. These reports covered everything from leads and opportunities to marketingâ€™s contribution to the sales pipeline, close/won deals, and revenue generated directly from marketing efforts.
