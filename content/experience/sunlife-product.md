### Took over ownership of Sun Life website

After my success optimizing the site, I fully took over the public facing website, adding agile development and publishing teams.

The team size is about 30 FTE's across the Agile dev team, SEO content team, personalization team, and publishing team where I've been able to set them up so I manage a team of teams.

My role involves defining the technical vision, strategy, and multi-year roadmap for the Public Web. I work closely with UX, Marketing, and IT architecture teams to create innovative, user-friendly experiences that meet both customer needs and business goals.

For sunlife.ca, I shape and deliver the application roadmap by identifying customer and business priorities, collaborating with teams across the organization—Risk, Finance, Legal, Security, Privacy, Operations, Marketing, Sales, and more—to gain alignment, and translating those needs into technical requirements. From there, I guide the teams through execution, clearing roadblocks along the way.

As Sun Life transitions to a digital enterprise, I champion agile-at-scale principles, ensuring cross-team and cross-business unit dependencies are well-planned and resolved quickly.

I’m fully accountable for the performance of our sunlife.ca digital channel, using analytics to uncover opportunities for improvement. My focus is on growing revenue, generating leads, increasing direct sales, and improving customer support. This includes leveraging tools like Adobe Target for optimization, UX testing, and live A/B testing.

I also own advisor leads targets for the website, and consistently deliver multi-million-dollar incremental value.

Beyond that, I continue to lead SEO for Sun Life Canada, ensuring our content reaches the right audience. In 2020, I also spearheaded the AODA digital compliance program, making sure all our websites and PDFs are fully accessible.
