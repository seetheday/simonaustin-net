### Moved to Sun Life to take on ambitious project to build the future for them, scaling real-time personalization across channels

After a good run at BlackBerry I decided it was time to try something new.  I had a decision to make between going to Accenture and Sun Life.  I chose Sun Life because the role was interesting, and I didn't want to be on the road 75% and away from my young family.

I was brought on to lead a $40M, multi-year initiative to implement cutting-edge Marketing Automation and Real-Time Decision Engine solutions, laying the groundwork for personalized digital client engagement.

A big part of the role was modernizing our dataâ€”moving it from legacy systems into a Big Data architecture that powered both analytics and marketing efforts. We scaled these tools beyond the web, integrating them into our call centers and mobile app to create a seamless, multi-channel experience.

With a team of 16+ project managers and business analysts, I ensured we delivered on time and on budget every year, turning a complex vision into a reality.
