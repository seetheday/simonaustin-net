### Laying the Foundation: Forced to hustle

I graduated university just as the dot-com bubble of the early 2000s was fully deflating. Like most of my graduating class, my full-time job offer—secured after a co-op role doing C/C++ development for a desktop application—vanished overnight.

Determined to keep moving forward, I took on whatever small local jobs I could find. If a project required a programming language I didn’t know, I learned it. Need someone to manage a *nix system? I was there. A database to set up or analyze? I’d handle that too.

After a series of short-term gigs, I joined a small software development agency called Openflows, which had contracts with some larger clients. There, I dove into web-based development using PHP, Perl, HTML, CSS, XML, and MySQL.

My role involved creating custom solutions for both intranet and internet sites, including workflow management tools, content management systems, and form management software. I also maintained Linux and FreeBSD servers and integrated Linux and Windows systems to streamline workflows.

Beyond coding, I collaborated directly with clients like USAToday, CBC, Mt. Sinai Hospital, Sunnybrook Hospital, York University, and The Walrus Magazine. I worked closely with them to understand their needs and deliver tailored solutions. Some clients wanted insights into how their websites were performing, but with no Google Analytics yet, I developed custom web analytics software to meet their needs. That opportunity became a key stepping stone in my career.

Being part of a small company meant I also wore many hats—negotiating contracts, managing projects, and more—giving me a well-rounded perspective. It was a hands-on, fast-paced environment that allowed me to combine technical expertise with client-facing experience, all while building systems that made a meaningful impact.
