### Took a role to optimize for impact.  Driving growth and breaking barriers.

I’ve had the privilege of owning SEO, SEM and Digital Optimization for Sun Life Canada, leading a small but agile optimization team that could rapidly test ideas using Adobe Target and the expertise of our in-house designers.

One of my proudest achievements was driving a 40% increase in advisor sales from our primary digital channel. This came through deep data analysis, rethinking media spend, and making significant process improvements.

Collaboration was key to success—I worked closely with teams across the organization to overcome obstacles, push through optimization ideas, and bring a shared vision to life.

Ultimately, these efforts generated sustainable, multi-million-dollar annual profits for Sun Life, proving the power of data-driven decisions and teamwork.
