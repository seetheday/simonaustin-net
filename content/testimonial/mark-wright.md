During my time at BlackBerry, Simon was pivotal to the development of Blackerry's marketing analytics practice; his deep digital measurement expertise in combination with his exceptional lateral-thinking skills were invaluable in developing a clearer understanding of mROI and, in turn, the attitudes, actions, and opinions of BlackBerry customers and prospects. I recommend Simon without reservation.
