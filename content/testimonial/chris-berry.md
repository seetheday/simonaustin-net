The state of Canadian digital analytics is better off because of Simon. 
 
Simon, at BlackBerry, is responsible for a non-trivial percentage of overall analytical spending in Canada. And not just for a year. But over a sustained, persistent, period of time. 
 
His influence extends from Kitchener-Waterloo all the way to Spadina and Adelaide streets in Toronto, and will often spillover into New York and Chicago. 
 
Simon works with a very heterogeneous audience within BlackBerry, ranging from executives who want the bullet points, directors looking to build solid business cases, and some of the smartest managers looking for exploitable market cleavages. He has effectively managed an orchestra of solid lines, dotted lines, sustainably, for several years. BlackBerry is better off because of his steady hand within digital analytics. 
 
He did this effectively, and to the benefit of the industry. A lot of people are a lot better at what they do because Simon. In many instances, he led and pushed for differentiating innovation. He's an effective collaborator. He took good risks in analytics. They paid off. This has an impact beyond well beyond BlackBerry. 
 
Simon has a background in physics and computer science. He understands and uses the scientific method. He understands technology. He really gets the business. This, too, is particularly rare and sets him apart. 
 
The basis for this recommendation, if you're ever able to work with Simon or hire him in the future, is based on what I know he's done first hand for the quality of analytics in Canada, and what he's done for BlackBerry over the years.
